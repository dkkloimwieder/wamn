//! The catalog-version lifecycle state machine (3.4).
//!
//! A catalog version moves through four states:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Draft ──stage──▶ Staged ──apply──▶ Applied ──(superseded on next apply)──▶ Superseded
//!     ▲                 │
//!     └─────unstage─────┘
//!   Draft / Staged ──discard──▶ (removed)
//! ```
//!
//! - **Draft** — editable; the only state the designer (3.3) may mutate content in.
//! - **Staged** — a frozen candidate, awaiting apply (impact-analyzed by 11.8).
//! - **Applied** — the live schema. Exactly one per (environment, catalog) — the
//!   single-applied invariant enforced by [`crate::Environment`].
//! - **Superseded** — a previously-applied version, kept as history.
//!
//! This module is the **pure transition table** (legal state changes, no
//! cross-version context). The cross-version guards — single-applied and the
//! stale-base rebase guard — live in [`crate::Environment`], which owns the set
//! of versions and their current states.
//!
//! The four state names are also the values of the `state` column in
//! `deploy/catalog-schema.sql`; [`State::as_sql`] is the authoritative mapping,
//! kept in lockstep with the DDL `CHECK` by a test.
